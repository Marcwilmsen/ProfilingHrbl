# About SoFa - Herbalife

*Project slotting optimization program based on Python as a main software platform.*

## Current situation

At the moment slotting is mostly done by hand. With the help of some data analytics, the historical data is consolidated and used for re-profiling. This takes a lot of time and is most likely a suboptimal solution.

## To be achieved

This project should lead to an optimization of the slotting. The aim of a new slotting program is to find a new, more optimal stock allocation based on the current slotting and the pick data of the previous period, taking into account all preconditions. Calculation time should be within an acceptable time frame (max 30 minutes) such that slotting can become more dynamic and we can take small steps every day. In an optimal situation, a product can be moved from one location to a new better location within 24 hours. Therefore only a limited number of products can be moved per day the program should take this into account.
